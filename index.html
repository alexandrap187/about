            <h1>About this Project</h1>
            <p>This project was created for my thesis surrounding my love for music, and combining that with design. For this project, my class was presented with a list of objects. I chose a clock, and turned my music taste into a time-based playlist. All 24 hours have 6 songs that correspond with that specific time, based on what genres I felt went best for each time of day.</p>
            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>My name is Alexandra Purdy and I am a graphic design student at Boston University. I recently have become interested in user interface design and web design, and hope to continue exploring those during my senior year thesis. </p>
            <br>
            <p>I encourage you to explore the rest of my work on my portfolio website!</p>

            <h1>CD Book</h1>
            <p>I created a physical version of this website using CDs, sticker paper, and a few other materials. I wanted a way to display the work I have done for my website in a physical space. Please continue to my portfolio website for more images of this half of my project! :)</p>
